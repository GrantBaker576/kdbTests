If data is to be fed to an algorithmic Q process for computationally expensive operations, the process should make us of asynchronous IPC so that the server does not have to wait on a response.
This data can be published when an event occurs, on a heartbeat setup, a batch setup, or using websockets to avoid API polling. 
The expensive operations can be distributed across multiple machines or cloud environments to speed up the calculations, allowing the server to work in parallel.
